Using XGBoost for Classification on the Iris Dataset
This repository demonstrates how to use XGBoost, a powerful machine learning library, to classify species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing 150 samples of Iris flowers with four features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable representing the species of the Iris flower.

Installation
First, install the necessary libraries:
pip install xgboost scikit-learn

Project Description
1. Loading the Data: We use the load_iris function from scikit-learn to load the Iris dataset and explore its structure.
2.  Splitting the Data :We divide the dataset into training and testing sets, reserving 20% of the data for testing to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
3.  Preparing Data for XGBoost : XGBoost requires data in its own DMatrix format. We convert the training and testing sets accordingly.
4. Defining Hyperparameters : We define the hyperparameters for the XGBoost model. The objective is set to multi:softmax for multi-class classification, and num_class is set to 3 for the three Iris species.
5. Training the Model: We train the XGBoost model using the defined hyperparameters and the training data.
 6.  Making Predictions : Using the trained model, we predict the species of the Iris flowers in the test set.
      7.  Evaluating the Model : We evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data using the accuracy_score function from scikit-learn.
8.  Experimenting with Hyperparameters: To demonstrate the effect of hyperparameters, we experiment with lower values for max_depth and fewer training epochs.

Key Points
Ease of Use: XGBoost provides a straightforward interface for training powerful machine learning models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different hyperparameters can help optimize model performance.
High Accuracy: XGBoost can achieve high accuracy even with default hyperparameters.
